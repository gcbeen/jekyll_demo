AJAX
---

To use a remote form you need to do something like this

	<%= form_remote_tag :url => @options.merge(:controller => @scaffold_controller), :before => fckeditor_before_js(‘note’, ‘text’) %>
	  <%= fckeditor_textarea( “note”, “text”, :ajax => true ) %>
	<%= end_form_tag %>

If you forget to put in the :before it won’t work, you can also use the fckeditor_form_remote_tag described below

Multiple Editors in a form
---

To create a form using multiple editors use the fckeditor_form_remote_tag helper and pass the :editors option. This takes an hash of model symbol keys with each having
an array as its value. The array should contain the list of fields that will have editors attached to them.

	<%= fckeditor_form_remote_tag :url => @options.merge(:controller => @scaffold_controller), :editors => { :multinote => [‘text1’, ‘text2’] } %> 
	  <%= fckeditor_textarea( “multinote”, “text1”, :ajax => true ) %> 
	  <%= fckeditor_textarea( “multinote”, “text2”, :ajax => true ) %> 
	<%= end_form_tag %>

There is also a fckeditor_remote_form_for version.
